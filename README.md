# NFL Analytics Toolkit

🚧 **Under Development** - Building a production-ready NFL analytics toolkit over 12 weeks

## Project Overview

A modular, well-tested R package for NFL play-by-play analysis, fantasy football predictions, and player analytics. Built with software engineering best practices and statistical rigor.

## Current Progress

- [x] Week 1: Data loading & validation infrastructure (In Progress)
- [ ] Week 2: Fantasy scoring engine
- [ ] Week 3: Player consistency metrics
- [ ] Week 4: Comprehensive testing framework
- [ ] Week 5-8: Feature engineering
- [ ] Week 9-12: Predictive modeling

## Installation
```r
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("nflfastR", "tidyverse", "nflplotR"))

# Clone and run examples
# Coming soon...
```

## Features (In Development)

- **Data Infrastructure**: Validated data loading with caching and error handling
- **Fantasy Scoring**: Modular engine supporting multiple scoring formats
- **Player Analytics**: Consistency metrics, feature engineering, similarity analysis
- **ML Models**: XGBoost predictor with interpretability
- **Testing**: 85%+ code coverage with unit and integration tests
